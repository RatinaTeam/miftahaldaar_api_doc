Certainly! Here's an explanation of what happens in the backend for each action of the `/order/<action>` endpoint:

1.  **Create**:
    
    *   The endpoint receives the form data containing the required fields for creating a new order.
    *   It creates a new instance of the `Order` model.
    *   It populates the instance with the provided form data.
    *   The order is saved to the database.
    *   An entry is created in the `OrderTimeline` to track the registration of the order.
    *   A success response is returned with a message indicating the successful creation of the order.
2.  **Update**:
    
    *   The endpoint receives the form data containing the order ID and the fields to update.
    *   It retrieves the existing order from the database based on the provided order ID.
    *   It checks if the user is authorized to update the order.
    *   It updates the order instance with the provided form data.
    *   The order is updated in the database.
    *   A success response is returned with a message indicating the successful update of the order.
3.  **Get**:
    
    *   The endpoint receives the order ID from the form data.
    *   It retrieves the order from the database based on the provided order ID.
    *   It checks if the user is authorized to access the order.
    *   The order details are returned as a response.
4.  **Register**:
    
    *   The endpoint receives the form data containing the required fields for registering a new order.
    *   It creates a new instance of the `Order` model.
    *   It populates the instance with the provided form data.
    *   The order is saved to the database.
    *   An entry is created in the `OrderTimeline` to track the registration of the order.
    *   A success response is returned with a message indicating the successful registration of the order.
5.  **Delete**:
    
    *   The endpoint receives the order ID from the form data.
